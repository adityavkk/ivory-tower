# Deep Research Task

## Topic
How can I use Harbor and inspect-harbor (the Inspect AI integration/bridge for Harbor) to build a general-purpose eval runner that can run different agent solvers against different benchmarks like Spider2, LongMemEval, and others? Specifically research: (1) Harbor's architecture - how it orchestrates agent backends, services, and eval tasks; (2) inspect-harbor's role as the bridge between Inspect AI's eval framework and Harbor's service management; (3) how to define and register new agent solvers (e.g. wrapping a custom agent as a Harbor-compatible solver); (4) how to define and register new benchmarks/datasets (e.g. integrating Spider2 and LongMemEval task suites); (5) the eval execution pipeline - how Harbor manages the lifecycle of running a solver against a benchmark; (6) practical architecture for a general-purpose eval runner that can mix-and-match solvers and benchmarks; (7) existing examples and patterns from Harbor's built-in eval support; (8) gaps, limitations, and areas where custom engineering would be needed.

## Methodology
- Use web search extensively to find current, authoritative sources
- Prefer primary sources (papers, official docs, original announcements) over secondary commentary
- Check publication dates -- prefer sources from the last 2 years where relevant
- When making claims, note your source
- If you find contradictory information, present both sides with sources

## Output Requirements
- Write a comprehensive research report
- Include a Sources section with URLs at the end
- Note gaps in your research -- areas where you couldn't find solid information
